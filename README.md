# SQL Projects

Hey there!

Thanks for checking out my data analysis portfolio repository. Inside, you'll find a bunch of projects that showcase my SQL skills and other data analysis skills.

Each folder in this repository contains a markdown report with all the details about a specific project. I tried to keep things interesting, so hopefully, you won't fall asleep while reading them.

If you have any questions or just want to chat about data analysis, feel free to reach out. I'm always down for a good conversation (or a bad one, I'm not picky).

Your friendly neihborhood Analyst!
