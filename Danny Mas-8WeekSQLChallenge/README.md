## Danny Ma's 8 Week SQL Challenge 

Danny Ma has a virtual appreniceship program and has been a great resource to the data community in regards to training and helping expand the analytical skills for anyone trying to get into Data Analytics. 

This challenge, which all details can be found [here](https://8weeksqlchallenge.com/getting-started/), was his way of creating an online community that would work towards helping eachother when learning a new skill like SQL. 

In an attempt to get more practice with SQL I've decided to tackle this challenge and document the process along the way to showcase within this repository. The challenge is designed around a case study per week for a total of 8 weeks. The following links are to each case study as well as the links to the folders in my repository showcasing my SQL Scripts and Analysis Journals.
